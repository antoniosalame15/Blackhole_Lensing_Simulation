# Simulation of Gravitational Lensing Around a Black Hole

## Description
This project simulates gravitational lensing effects around a black hole using C++ to demonstrate relativistic light bending. Developed collaboratively with peers,the project models how light is deflected by strong gravitational fields, providing insights into general relativity and astrophysical phenomena.

## Skills & Tools
- C++ programming
- Numerical methods and algorithms
- Astrophysics and general relativity
- Collaborative development

## Outcome
- Successfully visualized gravitational lensing phenomena and Einstein rings
- Implemented accurate simulation of light paths around a black hole
- Developed reusable C++ code framework for further astrophysics simulations
- Gained experience working in a collaborative coding environment

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Blackhole_Lensing_Simulation.git
