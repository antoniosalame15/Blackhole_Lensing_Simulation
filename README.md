# Blackhole_Lensing_Simulation
This project simulates gravitational lensing effects around a black hole using C++ to demonstrate relativistic light bending. Developed collaboratively with peers, the project models how light is deflected by strong gravitational fields, providing insights into general relativity and astrophysical phenomena.
